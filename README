NAME
    Data::Seek - Search Complex Data Structures

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
        use Data::Seek;

        my $hash   = {...};
        my $seeker = Data::Seek->new(data => $hash);
        my $result = $seeker->search('*');

        $result->data;

DESCRIPTION
    Data::Seek is a module for traversing complex data structures. This
    module allows you to select specific node(s) in a hierarchical data
    structure using a criteria. A criteria is an expression consisting of
    one or more criterion. A criterion is the part of the criteria that is
    used to select node(s) and sub-node(s) to be returned in the result.
    Data::Seek is akin to Data::Dpath but with far fewer features, a simpler
    node selection syntax, and a non-recursive approach toward traversal
    which makes Data::Seek extremely fast and efficient.
